### Notes
You must provide a tag either via the action input or the git ref (i.e push / create a tag). If you do not the action will fail.
If the tag of the release you are creating does not exist yet, you should set both the tag and commit action inputs. commit can point to a commit hash or a branch name (ex - master).
